# Project idea:
###### The idea behind the project was to build the first of its microservices to be more advanced. The plan was to build something that has a real-world impact on synchronous tasks, i.e. uploading large amounts of files or heavy files or downloading them. Also for this project I used Amazon's service - S3 for this one, because it takes a powerful machine that is able to save such amounts of data at once and a very common service used by companies/corporations, so I decided to use it and more or less understand what it connects to and is used for.

# What the project presents:
###### The project is made with the idea to use it in each subsequent project, because each project has sections with updating files or acting on them. When creating such a project, I thought about how it would be used in future projects.
